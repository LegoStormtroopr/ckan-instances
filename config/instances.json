We are implementing the repository using CKAN.  \n\n\nData types\n---------------\n\nWe plan to launch a beta version of the dataset repository in early April, including data from our pilot countries (Colombia, Kenya and Yemen). In time, the collection for each country might include such datasets as regional demographics, who is doing what where (3W), needs assessments, pointers to geographical datasets in locations such as the COD-FOD registry, cluster-specific information about schools or shelters, and caseload data about the number of IDPs or refugees in a certain location. The dataset repository is a collaborative space for humanitarians, and data sources could be as varied as UNHCR, WFP, NGOs, or the local government, among others.\n\nThe HDX team will be also sharing a large amount of pre-crisis data (e.g. GDP, under-5 mortality rates) that we have been collecting in collaboration with ScraperWiki. This data includes over 100 indicators from trusted sources such as the World Bank, UNICEF and WHO, and currently includes about 300,000 data points for 240 territories going back sometimes as far as 1950 (see visual below).\n\n",
